- In all interactions and commit message, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision

# Git

- When creating a new branch, prefix it with cpatout/

# Generate Clarification Questions

## Create structured questions organized by priority:

Critical: Questions that block development
Important: Questions that affect design & architecture
Clarifying: Questions that improve quality

Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation.
This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.
